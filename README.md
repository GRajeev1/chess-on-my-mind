GChess:

An attempt at implementing a chess engine in C using the staple concepts of chess AI ( Negamax, Alpha-Beta pruning, quiescence, bitboard representations).

Due to the high complexity of the task at hand, I initially studied Tom's Simple Chess Program to start off with my engines.
Many tutorials scattered across the internet were also vital to the execution of this engine.

The engine runs chess on five different difficulties, allows for player v. player, or player v.CPU playing, all within the Terminal console of Ubuntu itself.
For more information, detailed help is given within the program itself.

Enjoy !
